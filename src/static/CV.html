            1. <strong>Led a team of 4 to design and release a 15+ Unit SuperPro Simulation of a biochemical production facility of Human Serum Albumin (HSA) using a Lemna Minor cell line </strong>. First, this required kinetic engineering and material balances to calculate the growth of HSA on L. minor (using Monod growth estimation) based on past research and current designs (such as the Parabel facility) and then constructed a novel downstream purification section optimized for Lemna, using a series of PFF, depth, and TFF filtration units to lower chromatography resin costs in the later affinity column stage. 

As a next step, I performed a Techno-Economic analysis of this simulation rooted in sensitivity analysis of titer and selling price against CAPEX, OPEX, and cost of goods sold and released a technical memo, design poster, and abstract (all available for me to submit). Presented this research at UC Davis engineering college and WON the Biochemical Engineering best Student Design Award.

2. <strong> Designed the LibreTexts sidebar in Typescript/ReactJS, complete with site navigation and 20+ features for students, teachers, and developers.</strong> LibreTexts is a UC Davis startup focused on accessible and equitable access to teaching materials. As a student front-end developer, I designed to sidebar from its inception as a simple navigation tool in jQuery and added numerous features such as a 100+ unit conversion calculator, a citation and bookmarking system, and page accessibility tools. I started this project in 2019 and completely revamped it from native JS/jQuery into a fully modular design with Typescript and ReactJS, saving more than 2 seconds off load times (due to no more jQuery or large HTML code injections from the JS) and a large amount of memory. After completing the final version, the sidebar generated 1,000,000 site clicks monthly with commendations from other student developers and faculty.

3. <strong>Led the design and implementation of an E. coli green fluorescent protein (GFP) fermentation cell culture with an 8-member team. </strong>In past research, I submitted a technical proposal for glucose inoculation and fermentor preparation based on a logistic growth equation and average oxygen mass transfer. Performed the fermentation over 8 hours, taking standard measurements every hour and performing live troubleshooting of the cell culture (primarily related to oxygen level). Presented fermentation resultant and analysis showing GFP and biomass yields well within research standards to the principal investigator.
